problems:
    search watermelon instead of watermelon sugar (ongoing fix (yajiHub))
    total duration
    add track (ongoing fix (YajiHub))

Playlist;
    Play
    NExt
    Previous

Suggestion:
    ---- Adjust the menu when picking adding track, there should be a 2nd factor before continuing adding tracks like there should be "Do you want to add a track Y/N" prompt.
    ---- When viewing the music library there should be a menu on whether the user wants to only see the title,artists, Etc.
    DONE :When going into the menu viewing queue when writing a title that is not part of the music library. The code Terminates.
